## Part3
Licence defines the freedom a user have. It gives permissions to users whether they can use/modify/(re)distribute the project as you wish. With a license, you can make your project open source or make it a non-free software.

## Part4
As a project that does not have an explicit licence, the freedom of using/modifying/(re)distributing this project is undefiened. Troubles including legal considerations may come after using this project. Once the freedom of a project is explicitly defined by a license, the developer of the project cannot revoke the license and thus the permissions cannot be revoked.
